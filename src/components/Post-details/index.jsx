                        <p>
                          The size of the real estate market in Japan is 44
                          trillion yen as a whole, of which 4.4 trillion yen is
                          for brokerage alone. Even though itâ€™s not small, there
                          are few real estate agents in the market that
                          specialize in foreign investors.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          By conducting sales activities in English and Chinese,
                          we are able to overcome language barriers and make
                          proposals that better fit the needs of our customers,
                          achieving high customer satisfaction. In addition, we
                          aim for rapid expansion by making full use of the
                          personal connections and know-how that we have
                          cultivated so far.

                        <h6>Diversified culture</h6>

                        <p>
                          In a male-dominated, conservative industry, the
                          opposite concept of a bilingual female sales force
                          becomes superiority and differentiation in the
                          existing industry.
